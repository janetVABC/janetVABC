# 🌸 Janet's Website Portal! 🐩


**`High School Senior (Beginner website builder/Aspiring engineer/Dune fanatic!)`**

<div style="text-align: right"> I'm a grade twelve student excited to share my site! I created my main website as an informative portfolio, to share my future goals and some achievements. I hope you get a chance to check out my site and learn a bit more about me! </div>

 <summary><h3> 🎀 Janet's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my formal coding journey in grade 10, working through javascript and Java-esque programming languages, later on during my grade 11 coding experiences I learned so much more about syntax and usage of Java, a fantastic learning experience and one that allowed me to explore creativity and simplicity in code. After courses and personal work with Python this year, I was feeling inspired to make a website of my own and some web apps with an AI twist (to be released soon!). Working through my school's robotics program has also allowed me to experience some group work in code! I wish to continue some website updating and would love to one day share my own resources similar to the ones provided to me in the creation of the site! I wish you all take the time to check out my adapted work and be sure to take a look at some more website details above! Thanks :)

### 🌼 Website Details

## Description

Please note this is a beginner's project, my first website built on free resources and adapted to format a personal portfolio website. 

The website was developed as an icebreaker, showing my interests past a sometimes bland social media page. I wish to share the most formative moments of my high school career here, and wish for others to adapt this code and do the same! 

Much of the code was adapted from other sources kind enough to provide resources for a beginner like myself. I give a special thanks to each developer that provided a piece of content to be edited and adapted here. Thanks for checking my website out, and please take a look at portions of code from each of the talented people referenced in two languages as I did use some sources past North America! Please note ⭐️ I am not endorsed by, involved with, or condone or am aware of the further work of those referenced!
